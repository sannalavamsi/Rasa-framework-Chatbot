  utter_corona_intro:
  - text: "A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been 
           previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 
           2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly 
           circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold."

  utter_corona_spread:
  - text: "This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The
       first infections were linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now
       spreading from person-to-person. It’s important to note that person-to-person
       spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like
       measles), while other viruses are less so. The virus that causes COVID-19
       is spreading from person-to-person. Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19
       can spread the illness to others. That is why we recommend that these patients
       be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they
       are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.
       How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release
       someone from isolation is made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with
       doctors, infection prevention and control experts, and public health officials
       and involves considering specifics of each situation including disease severity,
       illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for that patient.
       The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably
       in the community (“community spread”) in some affected geographic areas. Community
       spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including
       some who are not sure how or where they became infected."

  utter_corona_food_spread:
  - text: "Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through
      respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission
      of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important
      to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food
      safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing
      or sneezing, or going to the bathroom."


  utter_animal_spread:
  - text: "Based on the limited information available to date, 
           the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low."


  utter_Prevention:
  - text: "Wash your hands often,Avoid close contact,Cover your mouth and nose with a mask when around others,
          Cover coughs and sneezes,Clean and disinfect,Monitor Your Health Daily."

  utter_corona_infected:
  - text: "Stay home except to get medical care,Separate yourself from other people,Monitor your symptoms,
           Call ahead before visiting your doctor,If you are sick, wear a mask over your nose and mouth,
           Clean your hands often,Avoid sharing personal household items."

  utter_corona_symptoms:
  - text: "Most common symptoms:fever,dry cough,tiredness. Serious symptoms:difficulty breathing or shortness of breath,chest pain or pressure,
          loss of speech or movement. Less common symptoms:
          aches and pains,
          sore throat,
          diarrhoea,
          conjunctivitis,
          headache,
          loss of taste or smell,
          a rash on skin, or discolouration of fingers or toes"


  utter_mask_mandatory:
  - text: "In general, children 2 years and older should wear a mask. However, CDC recognizes that wearing masks 
           may not be possible in every situation or for some people. Appropriate and consistent use of masks may be 
           challenging for some children, such as children with certain disabilities, including cognitive, intellectual, 
           developmental, sensory and behavioral disorders."


  utter_weather:
  - text: "It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of
      COVID-19. Some other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during
      cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with
      these viruses during other months.  At this time, it is not known whether the
      spread of COVID-19 will decrease when weather becomes warmer.  There is much
      more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated
      with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing."

  utter_high_risk:
  - text: "Older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions
      may be at higher risk for more serious complications from COVID-19. These people
      who may be at higher risk of getting very sick from this illness, includes;
      Older adults, People who have serious underlying medical conditions like...
      Heart disease, Diabetes, Lung disease."
